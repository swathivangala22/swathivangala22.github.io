                   At McKesson, I design and maintain scalable ETL pipelines using Python, SQL, and PySpark, ensuring efficient data ingestion and transformation. I have built cloud-based solutions with Azure Logic Apps, Synapse Analytics, and Azure Data Factory, optimizing data warehousing and enabling seamless integration. My work with Apache Hadoop and Spark has improved large-scale data processing, reducing compute time by 25%. Additionally, I implemented real-time data pipelines using Apache Kafka, ensuring high availability of business-critical data. By leveraging Tableau and SSRS, I have built interactive dashboards that provide actionable insights, improving decision-making efficiency by 20%. My expertise in data governance, compliance, and security has strengthened data integrity and access controls. As part of an Agile/Scrum team, I collaborate with cross-functional teams to ensure timely delivery of data solutions that drive business intelligence and operational efficiency.
